## Example project: OTUs

Researchers can characterize the composition of microbial communities by taking 
a sample of the community, sequencing a short section of the same gene 
(16S amplicon sequencing), and then clustering microbial DNA sequences into 
Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs).
In many human gut diseases, the composition of the gut microbiome differs 
between patients with the disease and healthy controls.
You want to investigate whether there is a difference in human gut microbiome
composition between patients with and without colorectal cancer, so you decide
to make a software package to carry out this analysis.

You have a large dataset that is already processed to cluster the sequences 
into OTUs and calculate the relative abundance of each OTU in each patient sample. 
This dataset has 500 patient samples and 7,000 OTUs. For the purposes of testing 
and developing your package, you make a small example dataset with 20 patients
and 10 OTUs.


## Interfaces

### Package Interface

You implement the features of your project as functions in an R or Python package.
The user writes a script that imports your package and calls your functions to
use it for their own dataset.

You wrote functions to convert a data frame of OTU relative abundances from
wide to long and plot the relative abundances as a box plot.

#### Python package

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

#### Python

Packages to help implement a CLI:
- click
- optparse
- argparse
- docopt (Kelly's favorite but no longer maintained)

#### R

R packages typically do not include a CLI; authors usually expect you to use 
their software from within R. However, there are options for implementing 
a CLI in R.

The simplest method is to define a function that ties together the main features
of your package. 
Users can run R code from the command line that calls your main function with 
`R -e "r_code_to_execute"`.

If you want to write a CLI that is similar to what you can do in Python, there
are R packages for that. Some are not well maintained.
